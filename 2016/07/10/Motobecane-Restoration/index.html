<p>Back in Feburary while helping my father-in-law repair his shed, I discovered his old Motobecane road bike.  When I first saw it I became a little excited because I thought it might be fun to restore, but he hadn’t ridden it in over 15 years or so and I had never restored anything before.</p>
<p>A few months later I was looking at road bikes for fun at our local bike shops and test rode a few.  That got me excited for a road bike, but I didn’t have the cash. Then I had the bright idea that maybe I could restore my father-in-law’s old Motobecane.  To say the least, it was in really bad shape.</p>
<a id="more"></a> 
<p>So over a few months, I set out to restore it.  The paint was really bad so I thought I’d repaint it, which I don’t recommend doing yourself unless you really know what you are doing (which I don’t).  Unfortunately I didn’t get any good pictures before I started but I took several pictures during the process:</p>

<p>I had to purchase a special freewheel hub removal tool to get this off.</p>
<img src="/2016/07/10/Motobecane-Restoration/b_atom-freewheel2.jpg" alt="Atom Freewheel up close" title="Atom Freewheel up close">
<p>I rebuilt the freewheel and replaced all the bearings. Keeping track of the tiny bearings can be difficult.</p>
<img src="/2016/07/10/Motobecane-Restoration/b_bottom-bracket-bearings.jpg" alt="Bottom bracket bearings" title="Bottom bracket bearings">
<p>I replaced the bottom bracket bearings. I couldn’t get the fixed cup off the bottom bracket and busted a 5/8” bolt trying to remove it using the method I found on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa8ztfXcHkg" target="_blank" rel="external">Youtube</a>!  I ended up doing my best to clean it without removing it.</p>

<p>My wife wasn’t thrilled helping out after I smashed her toe with the wrench.  She held the bike (I still don’t have a bike stand) while I turned the bolt with the huge adjustable wrench. The bolt busted and wrench came down and brused my wife’s toes and ankle.</p>

<p>I used Evapo-Rust to remove the rust from a lot of parts.  It worked well and is safe to use, however it is kind of expensive.</p>

<img src="/2016/07/10/Motobecane-Restoration/b_front-derailluer2.jpg" alt="Simplex front derailluer" title="Simplex front derailluer">
<p>This was very cheap simplex front derailluer.  However, since I didn’t have a lot of money to spend, I ended up using lots of cleaner and a hammer to un-seize it. That was after soaking it in the Evapo-Rust for 12+ hours.</p>

<img src="/2016/07/10/Motobecane-Restoration/b_headset4.jpg" alt="Headset frame" title="Headset frame">
<p>I replaced all the headset bearings. I probably could have reused them but I bought a bunch of different sizes on Amazon.com.</p>

<p>I replaced all the bearings in the hubs.</p>
<img src="/2016/07/10/Motobecane-Restoration/b_rim.jpg" alt="Rusty rim" title="Rusty rim">
<p>The rims were very rusty.  I used wire wheel on my drill to remove the rust on these. Not sure if that was a smart idea but I didn’t have enough solution to soak them.</p>
<img src="/2016/07/10/Motobecane-Restoration/b_paint.jpg" alt="Metallic silver paint job" title="Metallic silver paint job">
<p>I ended up hanging the frame up by rope while I painted it with spray paint.  First I primed it, then painted it silver, then finished off with a clear.  I didn’t do a very good job, but I tried.  It does look better than when I first started though.</p>
<img src="/2016/07/10/Motobecane-Restoration/a_derailluer.jpg" alt="Tourney derailluer" title="Tourney derailluer">
<p>I ended up replacing the rear derailluer, it was a cheap Simplex derailluer and had some broken pulleys. It was cheaper to buy the Tourney derailluer than to buy new pulleys.</p>
<img src="/2016/07/10/Motobecane-Restoration/a_crank.jpg" alt="Crank" title="Crank">
<p>The pedals were bent badly and didn’t spin well so I chucked them and used some plastic pedals I had lying around.  The crank itself turned out nice, and I didn’t even have to replace the cotter pins!  I recently got another bike off of Craigslist where the pins didn’t come out without a vice so I was surprised I didn’t have any trouble with these pins.</p>
<img src="/2016/07/10/Motobecane-Restoration/a_front_close.jpg" alt="Front close view" title="Front close view">
<p>I purchased new tires, tubes, cables, and cable housing.</p>
<img src="/2016/07/10/Motobecane-Restoration/a_handlebars.jpg" alt="Handlebars with new tape" title="Handlebars with new tape">
<p>New handlebar tape.  Youtube was a huge help on learning how to properly wrap these old 10 speed bikes.</p>

<p>I learned a lot from this project.  My father-in-law was very surprised.  I ended up giving it back to him for fathers day so he didn’t know I was doing anything to his old bike.</p>
<p>I’m looking forward to my next project.  It’s a <a href="http://www.sheldonbrown.com/retroraleighs/sprite.html" title="&quot;Raleigh Sprite" target="_blank" rel="external">Raleigh Sprite</a>. </p>
